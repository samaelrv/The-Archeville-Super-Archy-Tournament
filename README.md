Here are the general steps to run these Java files:

1) Compile Java files: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Java files are located.
   Then, compile each Java file using the javac command. 
For example:
javac ArcherBoardDriver.java Team.java Archer.java

This will compile ArcherBoardDriver.java, Team.java , Archer.java into bytecode.

2) Run the main Java file: After compiling, you can run the main Java file (the one with the main method) using the java command followed by the name of the main class.

For example:ArcherBoardDriver.java

This will execute the Main class, and the other classes are referenced within Main, 
they will be executed accordingly.

Ensure that all the Java files are in the same directory and that there are no compilation errors before running the java command. 
Additionally, if your Java files are part of a larger project with multiple packages, you might need to adjust the compilation and execution commands accordingly.
